we will have a deployment over kubenetes cluster using jenkins cicd pipeline 
in this project we are going with tools like github, jenkins, ansible, kubenetes cluster and we will learn for kubenetes we should know about deployment and services
and we will write ansible playbooks along with that we will try to write docker file ..

developer will write docker file it push git hub rep and git will get new comment it will notify jenkins through webhook a new code has come buid it 
once jenkis will start building , it will pullout all the code from git hub repo , it will ssh to ansible server , it will start executing the image ,based on docker file , 
once the ansible server build docker image , it will tag it and it will push it to docker hub , 
then again ansible server will take ssh to the kubernetes cluster server ,and ansible run playbook so that it will run kubectl command on webapp which is kubernets cluster 
it will try to fetch latest image , the same it will pull from the dockerhub and it will start building the image , from the image it will build container , 
from that container should be accesssible to ip at the port which going to enable by writing the service.yml in this kube cluster.

3 instances :
1. jenkins (default-jre + jenkins)
2. Ansible (python + ansible + docker)
3. Webapp (docker + minikube)
